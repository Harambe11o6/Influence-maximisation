# Influence Maximization on Facebook Network

This project implements **Influence Maximization** techniques on a Facebook social network dataset using Python.
The goal is to identify the most influential nodes (users) in a network that can maximize information spread.

The implementation is designed to run seamlessly on **Google Colab** or a local Jupyter environment.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Influence Maximization is the task of selecting a small set of seed nodes in a social network such that their influence spread is maximized under diffusion models like:
- Independent Cascade (IC)
- Linear Threshold (LT)

This problem is widely used in:
- Viral marketing
- Social media analysis
- Recommendation systems
- Network science research

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Facebook social network graph
- Nodes represent users
- Edges represent friendships / connections

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NetworkX
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Influence_Maximization_Facebook.git
cd Influence_Maximization_Facebook
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Google Colab
1. Upload `Influence_Maximization_Facebook.ipynb` to Colab
2. Upload the dataset if required
3. Run all cells

### Local Execution
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open:
```
Influence_Maximization_Facebook.ipynb
```
